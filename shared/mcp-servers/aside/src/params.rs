//! Tool parameter structs for the aside MCP server.
//!
//! Each `aside_<backend>` tool shares the same shape so the active harness
//! picks a backend by choosing a tool, not by threading a `backend` union
//! through a single params struct. Shared fields are factored through a small
//! builder below.
//!
//! Boolean and integer fields accept native JSON and JSON-encoded strings via
//! the lenient deserializers in `crate::lenient`.
