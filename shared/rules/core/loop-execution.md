# The Execution Loop

Understand, plan, execute, once per task. This file holds what the articles in `{{PRIMARY_MANUAL_FILE}}` do not imply on their own.

- **Read first**: harness and project instruction files, READMEs, main implementation files, tests, config; every relevant file completely. Check `git status` and `git diff` for user-owned changes (§ 12). An investigation reports files, behavior, flow and findings and changes nothing.
- **Plan** in writing before coding: problem, root cause, options with trade-offs, recommendation, steps, risks; the operating-envelope evidence (§ 9) and acceptance criteria against that contract; every completion criterion that needs the user's authorization (§ 3). The plan goes to the user before any file changes (§ 4).
- **Implement** the specification as written. Refactor when code repeats three times, a function does several jobs, or a naming or structure change is a clear gain; not without tests, mid-feature, or in unrelated code. Comment the non-obvious why; keep existing comments; write no deliberation or session-only phrasing into comments, commits or replies. Headers, comment language and doc-comment coverage follow the repository, then `{{HARNESS_RULES_DIR}}/{{COMMENT_PREFS_FILE}}` ({{PREFS_LOADING}}); a header states the file's responsibility and omits plans and tickets.
- **Undo** (§ 11): identify this session's edits from the tool calls, confirm the extent when ambiguous, reverse with {{EDIT_SURFACE}}. When the earlier content cannot be reconstructed with confidence, say which parts and ask whether to inspect `git diff` or whether the user wants to name a git command. A named commit, branch or ref is not a session undo: ask which git operation, then § 13.
- **Destructive git** (§ 13): `checkout --`, `restore`, `reset --hard`, `revert`, `clean -f*`, `stash drop`, `branch -D`, `push --force*`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`. Inspect with `git status` and `git stash list`, plus `git log --oneline` or `git reflog` for history-affecting commands. "Go ahead" to the proposed line is authorization; "just run it" to an earlier ambiguous phrase is not. When the command would destroy more than the user seems to intend, say what else is affected and wait.
