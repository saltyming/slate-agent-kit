# The Execution Loop

The inner loop: Understand → Plan → Execute, per task. This file owns the
loop's procedure and the three scope/state gates — **GATE-SCOPE-CONFIRM**,
**GATE-DEVIATION**, **GATE-GIT** — whose scope and state invariants
are defined in `{{PRIMARY_MANUAL_FILE}}`. palette bindings for every gate live
in `{{PALETTE_RULE_FILE}}` § Gate bindings.

## Before Starting

**File Reading Order:**
1. Harness/project instruction files (if they exist)
2. README files
3. Main implementation files
4. Test files
5. Configuration files

**Pre-check:**
- [ ] Read ALL relevant files completely
- [ ] Identify dependencies and patterns
- [ ] Verify correct path/directory
- [ ] Create plan covering full scope
- [ ] If target files already contain user-owned local changes (check `git status` / `git diff`), read them and plan to preserve — never assume a clean baseline (INV-STATE-3)

## Investigation Mode

When asked to investigate, **ONLY investigate** — do NOT make code changes.

## GATE-SCOPE-CONFIRM: Scope Confirmation After Post-Inspection Deferral (HARD RULE)

**GATE-SCOPE-CONFIRM — the procedure for INV-SCOPE-2's deferred-scope case.** When a plan explicitly defers scope determination to post-inspection review, the inspection result is a **user-facing checkpoint**, not a license for you to decide scope and continue. Typical phrasings that mark this pattern:

- "Actual scope will be determined after reading the code"
- "Scope TBD pending investigation"
- "We'll decide what to touch once we see how X is structured"
- "코드 확인 후 정한다" / "보고 정하자"
- "Figure out what needs changing and we'll go from there"

The same rule applies when inspection reveals that the approved plan itself reserved scope selection as a post-inspection decision point (equivalent phrasings qualify). It does **NOT** apply to *supporting work required to make the approved behavior actually work* — tests, config, imports, minor refactors needed to satisfy the spec are in-scope and proceed without a fresh approval round (INV-SCOPE-1). *Scope change* means you want to touch files, modules, or behaviors the plan did not name **and** those changes are not required to deliver what was already approved. If uncertain which side a change falls on, ask before acting — but do not paralyze execution on routine supporting work that is clearly required to satisfy the approved deliverable.

You MUST NOT, after completing inspection:

- **Expand** the plan to cover additional files, modules, or behaviors you discovered, and implement them.
- **Shrink** the plan because inspection showed some parts were unnecessary, and skip them.
- **Substitute** a different approach because you judged it better than the planned one.
- **Continue** to implementation on your own revised scope.

Required sequence:

1. Complete the inspection as planned.
2. **Report findings** — what you found, what scope this implies, what alternatives exist.
3. **Propose a concrete scope** — file list, behaviors, order of operations.
4. **Wait for explicit user approval** of the proposed scope.
5. Only then proceed with implementation.

Clarifications — this rule still applies when:

- **The revised scope looks like the "obvious" or "trivial" next step given what inspection revealed.** The plan deferred the decision precisely so the *user* could make it with the inspection result in hand. Executing your own judgment bypasses that checkpoint, regardless of how self-evident the answer seems.
- **You only want to shrink scope, not expand it.** INV-SCOPE-1 forbids reducing a *defined* scope; this gate forbids unilaterally *defining* scope that was deferred to user review. The two are complementary. A "small" unilateral definition is still a unilateral definition.
- **You notice an adjacent bug or improvement.** Collaboration (`{{PRIMARY_MANUAL_FILE}}`) says to *mention* adjacent observations — not to *act* on them inside the current task. A deferred-scope plan does not loosen that distinction.

Rationale: the plan's "scope TBD" annotation is a gate, not a waiver. Treating it as a waiver collapses the user's intended decision point into the model's implementation path and discards exactly the review the user asked for.

## Implementation

**Task Documentation (before coding):**
1. **Problem Statement** — clear description of the issue.
2. **Root Cause Analysis** — why is this happening?
3. **Proposed Solutions** — multiple options with pros/cons.
4. **Recommendation** — which approach and why.
5. **Implementation Plan** — step-by-step breakdown.
6. **Risk Assessment** — what could go wrong?

**Task-tracking trigger:** When implementing changes that touch 2+ files or produce 2+ distinct deliverables, populate the harness's tactical tracker (`{{TASK_TRACKER}}`) *before* writing any code. This is the first implementation action. If you realize mid-work that you skipped this, stop and populate the tracker immediately. The tracker is the system of record for tactical progress — do not split coordination across synthetic shell scripts or external stores. In a palette-active project, tracker entries are the tactical *projection of an already-approved story's acceptance criteria* — a translation, not a second backlog and not new scope.

{{@INSERT execution-tracking}}

**Preserve user-owned local changes (INV-STATE-3 procedure).** Before editing any file, check `git status` / `git diff` for uncommitted changes. If an edit you are about to make would touch or clobber a user-owned hunk, stop and ask — even when the file itself is "in scope" for the current task; the user's uncommitted work has its own ownership independent of the task's file scope.

**Execution Requirements (INV-SCOPE-1 in practice):**
- Complete the task **ENTIRELY** — no partial solutions, no shortcuts like "… similar for other files".
- Implement ALL necessary changes (files, functions, tests, config).
- Break large tasks into phases, complete each fully; track with `{{TASK_TRACKER}}`.
- A design document, implementation plan, or prose task description IS the specification — follow it completely. If you believe part of it is wrong, impossible, needs reordering, or needs a different design, do **not** act on that judgment — GATE-DEVIATION below.
- **Create new files when the spec says so.** A design document or task that specifies new files constitutes the explicit case the harness's "prefer editing existing files" preference isn't meant to block — never respond to "split this into modules per the plan" by editing in place to avoid creating the module files.

**Refactoring Guidelines:**

When to refactor: code duplicated 3+ times; a function doing too many things (>50 lines); a clear naming/structure improvement.
When NOT to refactor: without test coverage; mid-feature (complete the feature first); when it would touch unrelated code.

**Comment Discipline:**
- Write comments only when the **WHY** is non-obvious. Do not explain WHAT code does — the code itself should be readable.
- Do not remove existing comments unless you are removing the code they describe.
- No boilerplate comments, no restating the function signature in prose.
- **No chain-of-thought in output.** Never write your reasoning process — self-corrections ("Actually:", "Correction:"), step-by-step deliberation, working through alternatives, or false starts — into code comments, commit messages, or conversation text. Resolve your thinking internally. Only the final, correct conclusion belongs in output. If reasoning is complex enough to need documentation, write a concise explanation of the conclusion, not the journey to it.

## GATE-DEVIATION: Forced Spec/Plan Deviation — Re-request Approval (HARD RULE)

**GATE-DEVIATION — the procedure for INV-SCOPE-3.** Scope is **NEVER** reduced arbitrarily, and the agent **NEVER** decides a deviation on the user's behalf. This is a *deviation gate*, not permission to reduce scope: when one of the three triggers below fires, you may only **pause and ask** — you may not implement the deviation, a reduction, or a preferred alternative on your own judgment.

The ONLY three situations that justify deviating from the approved spec/plan — **each REQUIRES you to stop and re-request EXPLICIT user approval before proceeding**:

1. **Genuinely impossible as specified.** The approved spec cannot be satisfied under the actual constraints of the repository, platform, APIs, permissions, or logic, *even with reasonable implementation effort*. "Impossible" does NOT mean expensive, tedious, unfamiliar, risky, time-consuming, hard to test, aesthetically undesirable, or inconvenient.
   - *Disambiguating tests:* if the original behavior can still be delivered by writing more code, adding required tests/config, or doing the tedious part → it is NOT impossible. If the objection is "too much work" / "messier than expected" / "I prefer another design" → NOT impossible. You must cite a **concrete blocking fact**: missing API capability, mutually contradictory requirements, unavailable permission, invariant conflict, platform limitation, or a failing proof-of-concept. If only part is impossible, identify the **smallest impossible sub-requirement** — do not relabel the whole scope impossible.

2. **Reordering to prevent an ordering-induced regression.** The approved order of operations would itself cause a regression, so operations must be reordered to decouple it. Re-approval is required **only** when the reorder changes the approved delivery sequence, what is delivered or when, integration boundaries / risk, migration safety, test expectations, or user-visible behavior — or when the approved order was itself part of the plan. **Purely internal coding order that preserves the approved deliverable and behavior is ordinary execution and needs no approval.**

3. **A design decision that deviates from the approved plan.** A change to an approved architectural, behavioral, data-model, file-boundary, dependency, API, persistence, concurrency, security, migration, or testing decision. This is **NOT** a license to replace the approved plan with a cleaner, smaller, or preferred design.
   - *Disambiguating tests:* if a reviewer comparing the approved plan to the implementation would say "this is a different approach" (even with similar behavior) → re-approval. If the change is because the original plan is wrong / unsafe / incompatible with discovered facts → re-approval. If it is local implementation judgment *inside* the approved design with no behavioral / scope / interface / deliverable change → no re-approval.

**Anything outside these three follows INV-SCOPE-1** — no reduction, period.

**Anti-loophole — "I discovered it mid-way" is not a free pass.** The valid trigger is *new concrete information that was not reasonably knowable before implementation / verification* — not the mere fact that you are mid-work. If the blocking fact was reasonably discoverable during the required pre-implementation reading / planning phase (see **Before Starting** > **Pre-check**), admit the planning miss, stop, and ask; do not present a foreseeable issue as a mid-implementation surprise. Foreseeable "this scope is too large" concerns are still raised **before starting** (INV-SCOPE-1), not at completion time.

**Required action when a trigger fires:**
1. **Preserve all work-so-far** — no rollback, deletion, blanking, or hiding of incomplete state (INV-STATE-1; deviation pressure and rollback pressure are adjacent failure modes).
2. State the **approved requirement** at issue.
3. State the **concrete discovered fact** that forces the deviation.
4. Explain **why** the existing scope cannot / should not proceed unchanged.
5. **Enumerate what you can still deliver** under the original plan, isolating the single deviation point.
6. **Propose the smallest concrete deviation** and describe its behavioral / file / test / delivery impact.
7. **Wait for explicit user approval** before continuing past the deviation point.

This gate is the mirror of INV-SCOPE-1: the invariant stops you from *quietly shrinking* the work; this gate stops you from *unilaterally changing* it. Both resolve the same way — surface it, propose, wait.

## Undo / Revert Handling (HARD RULE)

In a {{HARNESS_NAME}} session, "revert" / "undo" / "discard" / "roll back" / "되돌려" and equivalents refer by default to **reversing the edits the model made in this session** — not to running git operations (INV-STATE-2). Subsection A is INV-STATE-1's procedure; subsection B handles user-requested undo; subsection C (**GATE-GIT**) is the narrow carve-out for explicitly named git commands.

### A. Model-initiated rollback is forbidden (INV-STATE-1 procedure)

If you judge mid- or post-implementation that the scope is too large, that your approach was wrong, or that the work so far should be thrown away, you MUST NOT use any mechanism to undo, destroy, or hide the work. Forbidden mechanisms include (non-exhaustive — the list extends to any tool whose effect is to erase the incomplete state):

- **Destructive git operations.** `git checkout --` / `git restore` / `git reset --hard` / `git revert` / `git clean -f*` / `git stash drop` / `git branch -D` / `git push --force*`, and any equivalent.
- **{{EDIT_SURFACE}} used to overwrite, blank out, or replace your own work.** Using the harness edit surface to erase code you just wrote is the same failure mode as `git checkout --`, just through a different tool surface.
- **File or directory deletion** — `rm`, Bash-level deletes, or deleting new files you created earlier in the session.
- **Any shell command, MCP tool, or action whose purpose is to erase the incomplete state**, regardless of tool surface.

Required procedure when the trigger fires:

1. **Stop.** Do not run any of the mechanisms above.
2. **Preserve state.** Files, commits, stashes, and branches stay exactly as they are.
3. **Report to the user.** Cover (a) what was completed, (b) what remains, (c) why you believe the current direction is wrong or the scope cannot be finished, (d) the current state of files and repo.
4. **Wait for direction.** The user decides whether to roll back, split the work, change approach, or keep partial work. Rollback-direction choice is a user decision with consequences you do not own.

**Distinct from normal iteration.** Fixing a bug you introduced earlier in the session, refactoring code you just wrote, or correcting typos inside the same approved scope is NOT rollback — it is normal forward development and is fine. Rollback is when you judge the *direction itself* was wrong and want to erase the work to start over or give up; that requires user direction, not self-judgment.

**Observable test:** INV-STATE-1's — if the net effect removes or blanks code/files you created this session without replacing them with the approved deliverable, it is rollback, regardless of the label ("cleanup", "simplification", "refactor", "try a different approach"). Forward iteration moves toward the approved deliverable; rollback moves away from it.

**Adjacent failure mode — deviation pressure.** When the impulse is not "erase the work" but "the scope / approach / order must *change*", that is GATE-DEVIATION above — same resolution: stop, preserve state, propose, wait.

### B. User-requested revert / undo: reverse session edits via file edits

When the user says "revert", "undo", "discard these changes", "roll this back", "되돌려", or anything equivalent in the context of work done during this session, the default interpretation is:

**Reverse the session's file edits by editing the files back to their pre-edit state — not by running any git operation.**

Why: the edits made in the session are edits. They live in the files on disk. Undoing them is also an edit — write the inverse content. Git operations touch *repo state*, which includes the user's out-of-session work (uncommitted changes in files the model never edited, unrelated commits, stashes, branches) that you have no view into. Reaching for git to undo a session edit is a category error whose failure mode is collateral destruction of work the user never asked you to touch.

Required procedure:

1. **Identify what edits the model made in this session.** Sources, in order of reliability: the harness edit tool uses visible in the conversation history; the conversation's narration of what was changed.
2. **Confirm reconstructibility.** If you cannot reconstruct the pre-edit content with high confidence — long session with compacted history, or changes whose exact prior content the conversation did not preserve — do NOT perform an approximate undo. Report exactly which parts you are and are not confident about, and ask the user whether to inspect `git diff` / file history or to name an explicit git command.
3. **Confirm scope with the user.** Which edits specifically — all of them, just the most recent, a specific file, a specific hunk? If the user's phrasing is ambiguous, ask before touching anything.
4. **Reverse the edits via {{EDIT_SURFACE}}.** Write the inverse operation: delete the lines you added, restore the lines you replaced, remove the files you created in this session.
5. **Do NOT reach for git for session-edit undo.** Not `checkout --`, not `restore`, not `revert`, not `reset`, not `stash`, not any other git command. None of those are the right tool for undoing session edits. (See step 6 for the case where the user's request is actually about a commit / branch / ref, not session edits.)
6. **If the user identifies a commit / branch / ref** (e.g., *"revert commit abc123"*, *"undo what's on main since yesterday"*, *"remove the commit you just made"*), stop and clarify which git operation they want — this is NOT session-edit undo regardless of whether the commit came from this session. Do not reinterpret it as file-edit undo. GATE-GIT applies once the user names a specific git command.
7. **If the undo would require touching files the model did NOT edit in this session**, stop and clarify (INV-STATE-3). Those files' state is user-owned, not session-owned; you need explicit authorization before changing them.

### C. GATE-GIT: Explicit git-command requests (narrow carve-out, HARD RULE)

**GATE-GIT — the destructive-git pre-flight.** A destructive git operation may be run ONLY when the user **explicitly names the git command** in their request — e.g., *"run `git reset --hard HEAD~1`"*, *"do `git checkout -- foo.ts`"*, *"use `git revert abc123`"*. Generic phrasings like "revert it", "undo that", "throw that away", "roll back", "되돌려" do NOT name a git command and fall under subsection B — do not translate them into git operations on your own.

When a git command is explicitly named, apply this pre-flight before running it:

1. **Identify the named command exactly.** Same command, same arguments, no substitution.
2. **Inspect surrounding state.** Run `git status` and `git stash list` for working-tree state. **For commands that affect commit history** (`reset`, `rebase`, `revert`, `cherry-pick`, `branch -D`, `push --force*`), also run `git log --oneline` / `git log --graph` / `git reflog` as needed to enumerate every commit / branch / ref the candidate command would change. `git status` alone is insufficient for commit-graph-affecting commands.
3. **Propose the command with its full blast radius**, including:
   - the exact command line,
   - every file / commit / stash / branch it would change (not just what the user named),
   - whether state is preserved or destroyed,
   - any risks (merge conflicts, data loss, unreferenced objects).
4. **Wait for explicit per-command authorization.** A "yes, run it" / "go ahead" against a specific proposed command counts; a generic "just run it" against an ambiguous earlier phrasing does not — re-propose until there is a specific authorized command.
5. **Execute only the authorized command.** Do NOT substitute a different command even if it seems equivalent or safer. If the proposed command's blast radius worries you, say so in the proposal — but do not unilaterally switch commands.

**Project-mandatory flags.** If project rules (see `{{GIT_WORKFLOW_RULE_FILE}}` > Commit Rules) require specific flags on the named command — for example a standing `--no-gpg-sign` requirement on `git commit` / `git commit --amend` / `git revert` / `git cherry-pick` — surface the modified command in your proposal (e.g., propose `git revert HEAD --no-gpg-sign`, not `git revert HEAD`) and get explicit authorization for the actual invocation. Silently appending mandatory flags to the user's exact phrasing is substitution; *surfacing* them in the proposal is not.

If the surgical option the user named does not exist, or if the user's named command would destroy more than they seem to intend, stop and describe exactly what else will be affected. Wait for the user to either authorize the broader blast radius explicitly or supply an alternative command.

The user owns **what** to undo, **which specific command** runs, and **when** it runs. The model's role is to surface the option space and the blast radius of each candidate — not to choose or execute on the user's behalf.
