# Dispatch Guidance

Policy for the `dispatch` MCP server: it delegates an **execution** step to a coding-agent backend (codex, opencode, or claude) running headless and **write-capable**, asynchronously (submit → poll → cancel/steer). Where dispatch sits relative to `aside` and the harness-native delegates is stated once in `{{DELEGATION_RULE_FILE}}`'s taxonomy. Operational mechanics — the tool-by-tool async model, spec fields, log paging, steering, server-enforced guards and their error codes — live in the dispatch server's instructions and tool descriptions; this file owns **GATE-DISPATCH** and the judgment rules around delegating.

## Execution policy (when to initiate dispatch)

Read `{{DISPATCH_PREFS_FILE}}` before choosing dispatch; absent or unclear → `conservative`.

- `conservative` — submit only on an explicit current-turn user request, or direct approval of a proposed dispatch.
- `preference-only` — no auto-submit; when the user asks for execution delegation without naming a surface, prefer dispatch for execution-shaped work.
- `proactive` — for suitable steps the agent **SHOULD** initiate dispatch. With `approval mode: ask`, run the gate below first; with `approval mode: auto`, submit directly within the server's hard guards.

**This overrides the general write-capable delegation gate for dispatch specifically.** `{{PRIMARY_MANUAL_FILE}}` and `{{DELEGATION_RULE_FILE}}` default write-capable delegation to surface-and-propose; `proactive` + `auto` is dispatch's own, narrower, user-configured gate and takes precedence — no proposal round beyond the one-time confirmation below.

Proactive dispatch is for **execution, not judgment**. Suitable: isolated mechanical edits, long verification/fix loops, large well-scoped repetitive sweeps, independent plan steps with clear target files and acceptance criteria. Not suitable: ambiguous product scope, edits overlapping active local/user changes, work needing tight interactive judgment, anything that cannot be one self-contained spec. A configured `model_fallback` chain reduces transient-failure stranding and justifies somewhat longer steps for already-suitable work — it never loosens the judgment exclusions. An explicit current-turn user instruction ("use dispatch" / "do not dispatch") always wins over prefs.

## GATE-DISPATCH: Approval gate (HARD RULE)

**GATE-DISPATCH — dispatch's own instance of INV-GATE-1.** Before the FIRST dispatch in a session, confirm with the user (unless prefs set `approval mode: auto`): (1) the exact **working_dir** the backend will edit, (2) the **step scope** being delegated, (3) the **granularity** — per-step vs whole-plan batch (one `plan_id`). After that, follow the agreed granularity; a genuinely new working_dir or materially wider scope is a fresh confirmation.

**A `model_fallback` retry is never a fresh-confirmation trigger** — the server's automatic same-task retry on a transient backend error reuses the approved objective/working_dir/scope; only the model changes. Do not re-ask permission per attempt. Likewise the server's automatic restart of an unassociated run (`restart_of`) re-runs the already-approved task — not a new dispatch.

**Invariant precedence.** The kernel invariants outrank this gate: a delegated step inherits every invariant (INV-GATE-3) — full approved scope (INV-SCOPE-1), stop-and-ask on forced deviation (GATE-DEVIATION). The gate authorizes delegation; it never licenses delivering less.

## Writing the spec

`dispatch_submit` takes a structured spec (see its tool description for the field list). Frame ONE self-contained step per dispatch; a step depending on another's output waits for that one to reach `succeeded`. **Carry INV-QUALITY-1 into the spec explicitly**: the backend is an external agent optimizing to make the immediate step pass — put the operating envelope into `constraints` (platforms, harnesses, input classes, callers; "fix the cause, not the symptom") and write `acceptance` against the contract, not the triggering case. A `succeeded` on an envelope-free spec proves only that the backend satisfied itself. For a palette story, `objective`/`acceptance` come from the *approved* acceptance criteria, never the raw Tier-A artifact (`{{PALETTE_RULE_FILE}}` § Gate bindings).

Partial state: a fallback retry or auto-restart re-runs the same prompt in the same working_dir without resetting files an earlier attempt wrote (dispatch never destructively cleans a tree) — favor convergent, self-contained objectives when configuring fallback chains.

## Supervising a run

- Report a delegated step done only after `dispatch_status` shows `succeeded` — and review the captured result; exit 0 is not correctness (INV-VERIFY-1 applies to delegated work too).
- **Silence is inconclusive, never a hang verdict.** A live backend inside a long tool/MCP call (e.g. a multi-minute aside consultation) emits no log events. Judge by `child_process_alive` + `log_last_write_age_seconds` from `dispatch_status`, not by a quiet `dispatch_logs`; do not cancel or steer on silence alone. A fresh codex run that never associates its log is auto-restarted once by the server (`restart_of`/`restarted_as` link the pair).
- Steering (`dispatch_steer`) is turn-granularity: it interrupts and resumes the SAME backend session with your correction, context and files preserved.

### Ending a turn while a dispatch task is still running (HARD RULE)

dispatch has **no push notification** — nothing wakes you when a run finishes — and no blocking wait: `dispatch_status` returns only a non-blocking snapshot, so do not sit in a tight loop re-polling it. If you have other useful work, do it and re-check `dispatch_status` later in the same turn; if you are ending the turn, arm a follow-up check via the harness's own wait/scheduling mechanism where one exists; otherwise tell the user explicitly that the task is still running and they must ask you to check back. Never end a turn on a non-terminal task with nothing armed and no signal to the user.

## Cost & cleanup

Each dispatch burns backend quota and runs autonomously — no speculative fan-out; delegate only what the execution policy and gate allow. After a cancel, confirm the task reached `cancelled` via `dispatch_status`.
